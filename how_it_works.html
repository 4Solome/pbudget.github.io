            Install the app onto your smart phone or tablet.
            At the first launch, the app will take you to the "Settings" tab.
            You can choose to enter personal info, which will go to the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) with every smell report you submit, so that they can follow up with you if needed.
            <span class="highlight-text">The "Settings" tab also lets you choose the type(s) of app notifications you want.</span>

            When you experience a pollution odor outdoors, launch the app and <span class="highlight-text">pick a rating for the smell</span> (from 1 through 5).
            <span class="highlight-text">Adding a description of the smell</span> (e.g. industrial) is highly encouraged, since this can help the county isolate the source.
            You also have the option to (but are not required to) <span class="highlight-text">list symptoms attributable to the experience</span> and <span class="highlight-text">send a personal note/question</span> to ACHD.

            Once the information is entered, submit the report.
            The information you report is then pulled together in an email format that includes the location (based on the GPS location of your phone), date and time, rating and description (if provided), and personal notes and/or questions to ACHD (if provided).
            This email is then sent directly to ACHD.

            Your location is obscured on the map by slightly shifting the coordinates to protect your privacy.

            Blue arrows which appear near the circles denote the wind directions as reported from that monitoring stations.

            The gray level of the square indicates the number of smell reports which have ratings larger or equal than 3 in the corresponding date.
