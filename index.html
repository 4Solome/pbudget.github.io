            Designing crowdsourcing platforms that afford collaboratively forming scientific knowledge to support community empowerment is a challenging task. In our case, Pittsburgh residents have suffered from poor air quality problems for a long time. However, the residents lack the technological fluency to report and track where industrial pollution odors are frequently concentrated. This makes it hard to form and share convincing scientific evidence of poor air quality issues among stakeholders. We present Smell Pittsburgh, a crowdsourced mobile application for reporting and visualizing pollution odors. The application invites Pittsburgh citizens to submit smell reports anonymously or with personal information. The smell reports are sent to the local health department automatically and visualized on a map together with air quality sensor data and wind directions. The application also generates push notifications to inform citizens about air quality changes when others report pollution odors or the air quality index increases over a certain threshold. We envision that Smell Pittsburgh can empower Pittsburgh citizens to advocate for themselves in revealing and tackling local air quality problems in industrialized urban areas.

            The above images demonstrate the user interface of Smell Pittsburgh. The left image shows the submission console. On the console, citizens can select the seriousness level of the smell, describe the characteristic of the smell, explain any symptom they are experiencing that may be related to the smell, and provide notes to the local health department. The middle image shows the setting menu, where users can decide if they want to receive push notifications and to provide personal identifiers when submitting smell reports to the local health department. The right image shows the map-based visualization with crowdsourced smell reports, sensor stations, and wind directions. Triangles indicate smell reports, with color denoting the level of severity. Circles indicated sensor stations, where the color means the seriousness of fine particulates. The bottom of the visualization features a timeline with squares, where users can select different dates. The gray level of the square indicates the average value of smell reports in the corresponding date.
