            <p class="text">
              In the Pittsburgh region, using the smell reports and the air quality data from local agency monitoring stations, we developed a statistical model to predict upcoming smell events and send push notifications to inform communities.
              The dataset and the code are <a href="https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/smell-pittsburgh-prediction" target="_blank">publicly available on GitHub</a>.
              Our analysis indicated that smell events in Pittsburgh are related to the joint effect of wind directions and hydrogen sulfide readings.
              This research shows that engaging residents in documenting their experiences with pollution odors can help identify local air pollution patterns.

            <p class="text">
              Smell Pittsburgh was launched on November 2016.
              To understand user engagement over time, we aggregate the number of smell reports and unique users by month, as shown in the following figures.
              We estimate the number of unique users by combining the results from Google Analytics and our customized tracker in the system.

              The system attracted more users in 2018, and they also submitted more reports when compared with the data in 2017.

            <p class="text">
              To investigate the concentration of smell reports across time, we compute the average number of smell reports per day, aggregated by hour of day and day of week.
              The following figures show that our users usually submit reports in the morning and rarely at nighttime.
              Also, weekdays have more smell reports than weekends.

              The patterns in 2017 and 2018 are similar.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              To identify critical topics in citizen-contributed smell reports, we analyzed the frequency of words (unigram) and phrases (bigram) in the text fields.
              We remove stop words and group similar words with different forms (lemmatization).
              The following figures show that high-frequency words and phrases mostly described industrial pollution odors and symptoms of air pollution exposure, especially hydrogen sulfide that has rotten egg smell and can cause a headache, dizziness, eye irritation, sore throat, cough, nausea, and shortness of breath.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
                The result discovered in the content analysis and the information obtained from informal community meetings suggested that hydrogen sulfide might be the primary source of odor pollution.
                In the research paper, we have used statistical methods to select a subset of smell reports and analyze the relationship between these reports with hydrogen sulfide.
                In the bottom figure, we visualize the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00116251.pdf" target="_blank">decision tree</a> (i.e., the statistical model) and the pattern.

                The decision tree is analogous to how a medical doctor diagnoses patients.
                The top level of the tree shows the most important predictor, which is the interaction between the wind directions at Parkway monitoring station and the hydrogen sulfide concentration at the Liberty monitoring station.
                The Allegany County Health Department operates these stations.
                Based on this finding, we further investigate such relationships on a daily scale.
